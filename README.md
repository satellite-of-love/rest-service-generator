# REST Service Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/satellite-of-love/rest-service-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/satellite-of-love/rest-service-generator)

## Rugs

Generate a new REST Service up to satellite-of-love standards.

# This is also a working REST Service
... which lets us be pretty sure we haven't screwed up the template.

## Development

This project is driven using [Maven][mvn].  You will need to install
Maven locally to build, run, and test this project.

[mvn]: https://maven.apache.org/

### Run locally

You can run the service locally using the following from the command:

```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Run tests

This service comes with some rudimentary tests as a good starting
point for writing your own.  Use the following command to execute the
tests using Maven:

```
$ mvn test
```
