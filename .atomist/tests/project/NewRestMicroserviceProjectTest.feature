    Then the class source file should not contain the original package name
    Then the class test file should not contain the original class name
    Then the class test file should not contain the original package name
    Then the source directory should contain only the minimum files  // TODO: implement rug#539 so that I can implement this test
    Then the test directory should contain only the minimum files
    Then the POM file contains the artifact ID
    Then the POM file contains the version

    Then the README contains help
    Then the README contains Spring Boot
    Then the README contains Maven link

    Then parameters were valid
    Then the POM file contains the artifact ID
    Then the POM file contains the version
    Then the README contains the project name
    Then the props file should exist
    Then the props file contains the server port
    Then the LICENSE file should not exist
